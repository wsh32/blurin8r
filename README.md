# blurin8r

Hack the Northeast 2020 project.

### tl;dr

The point of the **blurin8r** project is to shield the privacy of people who are
unintentionally in the background of pictures and videos posted on social media.
Ironically, when many people try to call attention to protests by posting on
social media, they endanger the protesters by showing their faces.
